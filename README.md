# Youtube Downloader

## Overview
This Python script provides a simple way to download YouTube videos. I created this tool before going on a road trip to ensure I had entertainment during the parts of the car ride lacking cell service. Moreover, it helped me avoid the need for YouTube Premium subscriptions, allowing me to enjoy videos offline without incurring extra costs.

## Usage
To run the script follow the given directions:
1. Make sure you have python3 installed (this can be verified with ```python3 --v```)
2. Download pytube if you haven't already using ```pip3 install pytube```
3. Clone the repo and navigate to the corresponding directory
4. run the code by typing ```python3 downloader.py youtube_link directory```.
5. Wait for a few minutes for your video to download.
